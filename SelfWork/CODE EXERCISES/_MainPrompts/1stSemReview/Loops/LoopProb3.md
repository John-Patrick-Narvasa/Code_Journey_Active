# Problem Title/Task Title: Odd Number Sum with Nested Loops

## Problem/Task Summary:
Write a Java program that calculates the sum of all odd numbers from 1 to a given number `n`. Use a nested loop structure where the outer loop iterates through numbers from 1 to `n`, and the inner loop checks if a number is odd. Additionally, include a condition that handles edge cases where `n` is less than or equal to zero.

### Example Input/Output:
- **Input 1:** `n = 10`  
  **Output 1:** `Sum of odd numbers: 25`
  
- **Input 2:** `n = 0`  
  **Output 2:** `Invalid input. Please enter a number greater than zero.`

- **Input 3:** `n = -5`  
  **Output 3:** `Invalid input. Please enter a number greater than zero.`

## Constraints:
- The input `n` should be an integer.
- If `n` is negative or zero, output an error message.

# Problem Title/Task Title: Multiplication Table with Do-While Loop

## Problem/Task Summary:
Create a Java program that prints the multiplication table for a number entered by the user. Use a do-while loop to ensure the user can enter a number until they provide a valid positive integer. The table should display results from 1 to 10. Handle edge cases where the input is invalid.

### Example Input/Output:
- **Input 1:** `number = 5`  
  **Output 1:**  
  ```
  5 x 1 = 5  
  5 x 2 = 10  
  5 x 3 = 15  
  5 x 4 = 20  
  5 x 5 = 25  
  5 x 6 = 30  
  5 x 7 = 35  
  5 x 8 = 40  
  5 x 9 = 45  
  5 x 10 = 50  
  ```

- **Input 2:** `number = -3`  
  **Output 2:** `Invalid input. Please enter a positive integer.`

- **Input 3:** `number = 0`  
  **Output 3:** `Invalid input. Please enter a positive integer.`

## Constraints:
- Must use a do-while loop for input validation.
- Input should be an integer greater than zero.

# Problem Title/Task Title: Factorial Calculator with For Loop

## Problem/Task Summary:
Develop a Java program that calculates the factorial of a number using a for loop. The program should be able to handle edge cases, such as when the input is a negative number or a very large number that could cause overflow. Provide appropriate messages for these conditions.

### Example Input/Output:
- **Input 1:** `number = 5`  
  **Output 1:** `Factorial of 5 is 120`
  
- **Input 2:** `number = -2`  
  **Output 2:** `Invalid input. Factorial is not defined for negative numbers.`

- **Input 3:** `number = 20`  
  **Output 3:** `Factorial of 20 is 2432902008176640000`

## Constraints:
- The input must be a non-negative integer.
- Handle overflow cases for large integers.
