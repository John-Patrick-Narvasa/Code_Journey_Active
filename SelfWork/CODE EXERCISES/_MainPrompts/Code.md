# 1st prompt


## Starting RN

	here are the topics we have already tackled in java programming: 

	conditions
	loops
	arrays
	methods
	string manipulation
	recursion
	packages and modifiers


	now, list some programs we can make using packages



	what about a list of programs that is more on mathematical puzzles and patterns using packages

# 2nd prompt (Post) 
Document and Summarize everything about all the pre existing context of the quizzes you have made with an emphasis to the edge cases being considered with simple examples 


along with dissecting its logic of each nature according to the quizzes being made previously in a bullet form

Also find the techniques and patterns used in order to answer all those questions correctly consistently

simulate (on table form)this java program in a way for example: 

*put T or F, if variable is under condition or loop and organize if using multiple methods or classes*
variable 1 | variable 2 | variable 3 | variable... | Output
