### **Quiz Items:**

#### **Problem 1: Daily Life Situation - Grocery Shopping**

**Problem Title/Task Title:** Calculate Total Grocery Cost  
**Problem/Task Summary:**  
You are at a grocery store, and you want to calculate the total cost of items in your cart. Each item has a price, and you want to apply a discount if the total cost exceeds a certain amount. Write a Java program to calculate the total cost after applying the discount.  

**Example Input/Output:**  
- Input: Item prices = [10, 20, 30, 40], Discount threshold = 80, Discount rate = 10%  
- Output: Total cost = 90 (Original total = 100, Discount = 10)  

**Constraints:**  
- Use a `for` loop to iterate through the item prices.  
- Apply the discount only if the total cost exceeds the threshold.  
- Print the final total cost.

#### **Problem 2: Code Simulation - Poorly Written Code**

**Problem Title/Task Title:** Simulate the Output of Poorly Written Code  
**Problem/Task Summary:**  
The following Java code is poorly written with unclear variable names and logic. Simulate its output and explain what it does.  

**Code:**
```java
int x = 5, y = 0;
while (x > 0) {
    y += x;
    x--;
}
System.out.println(y);
```

**Example Input/Output:**  
- Input: None  
- Output: 15  

**Constraints:**  
- Explain the logic of the code.  
- Identify any potential issues with the code (e.g., readability, efficiency).

#### **Problem 3: Program Enhancement and Debugging - Temperature Conversion**

**Problem Title/Task Title:** Fix the Temperature Conversion Program  
**Problem/Task Summary:**  
The following Java program is supposed to convert temperatures from Celsius to Fahrenheit for a given range. However, it contains errors and does not work as intended. Debug and enhance the program to make it functional.  

**Code:**
```java
int start = 0, end = 10;
while (start <= end) {
    double fahrenheit = (start * 9 / 5) + 32;
    System.out.println("Celsius: " + start + " -> Fahrenheit: " + fahrenheit);
}
```

**Example Input/Output:**  
- Input: start = 0, end = 10  
- Output:  
  ```
  Celsius: 0 -> Fahrenheit: 32.0
  Celsius: 1 -> Fahrenheit: 33.8
  ...
  Celsius: 10 -> Fahrenheit: 50.0
  ```

**Constraints:**  
- Fix the infinite loop issue.  
- Ensure the program prints the correct Fahrenheit values for the given Celsius range.

### **Answers:**

#### **Problem 1: Calculate Total Grocery Cost**
```java
public class GroceryCost {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        double[] prices = {10, 20, 30, 40};
        double discountThreshold = 80;
        double discountRate = 0.10;
        double totalCost = 0;

        for (double price : prices) {
            totalCost += price;
        }

        if (totalCost > discountThreshold) {
            double discount = totalCost * discountRate;
            totalCost -= discount;
        }

        System.out.println("Total cost: " + totalCost);
    }
}
```

**Output:**  
```
Total cost: 90.0
```

#### **Problem 2: Simulate the Output of Poorly Written Code**
**Explanation:**  
The code calculates the sum of integers from 5 to 1 using a `while` loop. The variable `y` accumulates the sum, while `x` decrements from 5 to 0. The final value of `y` is 15 (5 + 4 + 3 + 2 + 1).  

**Issues:**  
- Poor variable naming (`x` and `y` are not descriptive).  
- The code is simple but could be made more readable with better variable names and comments.  

**Output:**  
```
15
```

#### **Problem 3: Fix the Temperature Conversion Program**
```java
public class TemperatureConversion {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        int start = 0, end = 10;
        while (start <= end) {
            double fahrenheit = (start * 9 / 5.0) + 32;
            System.out.println("Celsius: " + start + " -> Fahrenheit: " + fahrenheit);
            start++; // Fix: Increment start to avoid infinite loop
        }
    }
}
```

**Output:**  
```
Celsius: 0 -> Fahrenheit: 32.0
Celsius: 1 -> Fahrenheit: 33.8
Celsius: 2 -> Fahrenheit: 35.6
Celsius: 3 -> Fahrenheit: 37.4
Celsius: 4 -> Fahrenheit: 39.2
Celsius: 5 -> Fahrenheit: 41.0
Celsius: 6 -> Fahrenheit: 42.8
Celsius: 7 -> Fahrenheit: 44.6
Celsius: 8 -> Fahrenheit: 46.4
Celsius: 9 -> Fahrenheit: 48.2
Celsius: 10 -> Fahrenheit: 50.0
```
