Sure! Here are the tasks based on your requirements:

### Problem Title/Task Title: Count Even and Odd Numbers in a List

**Problem/Task Summary:**  
Write a Java program that takes a list of integers and counts how many even and odd numbers there are. Use a `while` loop to iterate through the list, and include edge cases, such as an empty list and a list with all even or all odd numbers.

**Example Input/Output:**
1. Input: `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5]`  
   Output: `Even: 2, Odd: 3`
   
2. Input: `[]`  
   Output: `Even: 0, Odd: 0`
   
3. Input: `[2, 4, 6, 8]`  
   Output: `Even: 4, Odd: 0`

**Constraints:**  
- The list can have up to 100 integers.
- Integers can be both positive and negative.

### Problem Title/Task Title: Multiplication Table Generator

**Problem/Task Summary:**  
Create a Java program that generates a multiplication table for a given number using a `for` loop. The table should go up to 10 times the number. Ensure to handle edge cases, such as negative numbers and zero.

**Example Input/Output:**
1. Input: `5`  
   Output: 
   ```
   5 x 1 = 5
   5 x 2 = 10
   ...
   5 x 10 = 50
   ```

2. Input: `0`  
   Output: 
   ```
   0 x 1 = 0
   ...
   0 x 10 = 0
   ```

3. Input: `-3`  
   Output: 
   ```
   -3 x 1 = -3
   ...
   -3 x 10 = -30
   ```

**Constraints:**  
- The input number can be any integer.

### Problem Title/Task Title: Pyramid Pattern with Nested Loops

**Problem/Task Summary:**  
Write a Java program that prints a pyramid pattern of stars. The number of rows should be specified by the user. Use nested `for` loops to achieve this. Ensure to handle edge cases, such as a negative number of rows.

**Example Input/Output:**
1. Input: `5`  
   Output: 
   ```
        *
       ***
      *****
     *******
    *********
   ```

2. Input: `0`  
   Output: (no output)

3. Input: `-3`  
   Output: (no output)

**Constraints:**  
- The number of rows should be between 0 and 20.
